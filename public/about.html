<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>12 years old. Currently still a student.</p>

<p>Hey! It's Enya here! I am currently 12 years old, and really enjoy coding. I've made this website portfolio to show off all my work.</p>

<p>Other than coding, I really love reading, writing, and debate. I have won multiple awards debating and writing, and one of my all time favorite books are Shadow and Bone, and The Sun is Also a Star. I am leaning more on the 'right side of the brain' if you get what I mean.</p>
